**Abstract**: Next-generation multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study generative artificial intelligence (AI) agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design, from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.

Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple- output (XL-MIMO) is believed to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. XL-MIMO uses more antennas to both achieve unprecedented spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) and exploit new electromagnetic (EM) phenomena occurring in the radiative near-field. The near-field effects provide the XL-MIMO array with depth perception, enabling precise localization and spatially multiplexing jointly in the angle and distance domains. This article delineates the distinctions between near-field and far-field propagation, highlighting the unique EM characteristics introduced by having large antenna arrays. It thoroughly examines the challenges these new near-field characteristics pose for user localization and channel estimation and provides a comprehensive review of new algorithms developed to address them. The article concludes by identifying critical future research directions.
